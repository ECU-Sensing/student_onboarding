## Instructions for Github Desktop

Just to provide a short demonstration of Github Desktop follow the following steps:

1. Sign into your Github account. Either on first load or by going to File > Options > Accounts 
   -   This is important to for private repositories which many are in our case
2. Clone the test repo
   1. Find the test repo on Github.com in our ECU_Sensing Organization (hint: name = 'student_test_repo')
   2. On Github.com look for the Green '<> Code' Button. Click that and copy the URL from the dropdown menu (hint: make sure the tab bar is set to HTTPs) or Optionally, you can select 'Open with Github Desktop'
   3. Return to Github Desktop, if you simply copied the url you will need to select Add > Clone Repository > enter URL in and select your preferred location > Clone. If you selected 'Open with Github Desktop' it should automatically be cloned for you and prompt you to select your preferred location
   4. Once cloned, select the repo from the left menu and look for the 'Open in Visual Studio Code' button in the middle. Select it.
   5. This should open up VSCode. Add a file titled [Your_Name].txt (ex. colby.txt) and enter in some random text.
   6. Return to Github Desktop, you should now see your file listed in the left menu as a new change. On the same left menu give your commit a title ('Summary') and short description. Once completed hit 'Commit to main'
   7. You should now notice the changes disappear from the left menu and now there is a 'Push to remote' and 1 near the top. You can complete the push by selecting it. 


Congratulations, you have now utilized Github, Git and Github Desktop to clone, make changes, commit, and push to a repository. We will eventually work with more complicated functions like pull, branching, merging and etc.
