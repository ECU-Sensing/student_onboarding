# Instructions for VSCode

Just to provide a short demonstration of VSCode and setup some helpful tools follow the following steps:

1. On first launch or by selecting User Icon (lower left) > Account, sign into your Github account. This will make it easier later if you'd like to manage Git operations with VSCode instead of Github Desktop.
2. Select the 3 squares with 1 square being added in the left submenu (Extensions) and install the following extensions:
   1. Python
   2. Markdown All in one (you can install any markdown extension, I just use this one)
   3. Code Spell Checker (will save you often)
   4. C#
   5. autoDocstring - Python Docstring Generator
   6. Arduino
3. You will now have sufficient tools to work with many of the ESDN code bases. 
4. Familiarize yourself with the left menu, primarily with the Explorer (file on top), and Search. Both will be instrumental to navigate and or find files/ pieces of code in the sources.
